        <h1>Wheelchair Access at Disney World</h1>
        <h2>Can I rent a Wheelchair, Stroller, or ECV?</h2>
        <p>Disney provides a stroller, wheelchair, and ECV rental service. 
            Rentals can be purchased and picked up at the front of the parks. Rentals can be purchased daily or for the length of your stay.
            If you are planning on staying at the parks for multiple days, it is recommended to purchase the multi-day pass since the price will be
            about $2 less per day. It is also recommended to go to the parks early to rent these vehicles since rentals are on a first come first serve 
            basis and reservations are not available. Also note that there is a refundable $100 deposit to rent.</p>
            <p>To see what types are available, what prices, and where to purchase them, 
            go to the Disney links provided below for the corresponding rental type. </p>

        <h3>Do I need to transfer from my wheelchair?</h3>
        <p>According to Disney World's website, there are three categories of attraction access: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Must to transfer from wheelchair/ECV to ride vehicle</li>
            <li>Must transfer from ECV to wheelchair</li>
            <li>Must transfer from ECV to wheelchair, and from wheelchair to ride vehicle</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important to note that cast members can not help assist you in the transfer. Please make sure to have a party member with you
            who can help you transfer if needed. Most rides have a secondary queue to enter for those in wheelchairs. Ask a cast member at the front of the attraction
        about which line to enter. </p>
        <p>Wheelchair access is available on all Disney transportation including: Monorails, busses, trains, boats, and the skyliner.</p>

        <section class="restroom_text"></section>
        <h4>Are there accessible restrooms?</h4>
        <p>Each restroom at Disney World typically has the traditional wheelchair accessible stall, but larger 
            restroom with more features are available. These restrooms are known as companion restrooms on the park maps.
            While these restrooms are larger, they do not have has many facilities as the ones at Tokyo Disney Land. If you need additional
            facilities like a sink for ostomates, please visit the first aid center at the park.
